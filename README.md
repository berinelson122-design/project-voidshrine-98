## How to actually run this masterpiece:

Since this isn't a Unity game and was made with React + Vite, you need Node.js to run the dev environment.

1. **Clone it:**
   `git clone https://github.com/berinelson122-design/project-voidshrine-98.git`

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   `cd project-shrine-98`
   `npm install`

3. **Start the engine:**
   `npm run dev`

4. **Open it:**
   It usually runs on a local server `http://localhost:5173`.

**Note:** If you want to use the build version (the one on Itch), just run `npm run build` and serve the `dist` folder.
